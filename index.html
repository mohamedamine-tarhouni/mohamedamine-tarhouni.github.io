  Redirecting to your entry point...

Replace /your-entry-point with the correct URL path to your Laravel application's entry point. This will typically be something like /public/index.php or /index.php.

Save the 404.html file and commit it to the master branch of your repository.

Once you've created the custom 404.html file, your GitHub Pages URL should redirect to your Laravel application's entry point when accessed.
